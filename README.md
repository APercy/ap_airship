Minetest 5.4 mod: Airship
========================================

This mod implements an airship for minetest. This airship is affected by the wind. The wind better works
with Climate API
THIS IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND HAVE A LOT OF MISSING FEATURES. AND I KNOW IT
I will remove the above text in future, I hope.

Shortcuts:

punch with dye to paint
forward and backward while in drive position: controls the power lever
left and right while in drive position: controls the direction
jump and sneak: controls the up and down movement

- right click to enter and access menu
- E + right click while inside: acess inventory
- E + backward while in drive position: the machine does backward
- E + foward while in drive position: extra power

Tip:
Drive it gently.
The captain can leave the drive position to walk too
If a player goes timeout or logoff in flight, the blimp will "rescue" him if no other player
enter the blimp, so is a good idea wait the friend at a secure place far from anyone who
wants to enter the blimp.

Know issues:
The walk movement inside the ship is affected by server lag, because the lack of
an interpolation method on attach function.
